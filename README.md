# Toman_Bike_Share
In this project, I worked as a data analyst for Toman Bike Share, with the goal of analyzing revenue and user behavior to support the decision of whether increasing prices next year is feasible.

I used SQL Server for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation. Then, I connected the processed data to Power BI, where I built an interactive dashboard showing:

Average revenue per hour and per day of the week.

Monthly revenue trends (KPI Over Time).

Seasonal revenue distribution.

Rider demographic breakdown (casual vs registered users).
